# Plus Minus

## Explanation of my answer

To set up the plus minus we first got the whole length of the passed in array.

I then built a for loop, to loop through each number in the array to see which type of number they are (positive, negative or zero).

Finally, I calculated the ratio by doing `array total / total of type of number` and then using `parseFloat()` and `toFixed` to set the number of decimal points returned.
