# Simple Array Sum

## Explanation of my answer

Quite easy, we set a variable to store the total and then loop through each
integer in the array and add it to the total variable, and then we return
that sum.

We can do this in a much simpler & easier way by just using the [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) function
built in to Javascript, which just totals all integers in an array. However, I felt like that was cheating. ðŸ˜‡
