# Mini-Max Sum

## Explanation of my answer

Quite an easy task, I first sorted the array in ascending numeric order and
then I removed the first value to get the maximum total, and then reinserted it
& removed the last value to get the minimum total.

I then pushed both the maximum & minimum total up to a tuple and returned it.
